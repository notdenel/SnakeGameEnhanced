# Snake Game Enhanced

## Description
For my final project in CSEN 160 (Object-Oriented Analysis, Design, and Programming), we were instructred to create a simple game from scratch or add new features/twists to an already existing one. This was my first foray into creating my own projects and using previous years' knowledge for something practical. I hope you enjoy!

### Key Features
- **Color Matching System**: Multiple colored apples and color-changing snake
- **Strategic Gameplay**: Players may have to plan out routes and think ahead 
- **Multiple Obstacles**: Increased complexity with natural barriers (miscolored apples)

## Game Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake
- **Esc/Space**: Pause/Resume game
- **Menu Options**: Navigate/customize game settings
